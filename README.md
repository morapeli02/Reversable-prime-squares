# Reversable-prime-squares
This is a repository for a code at different levels of instruction set architecture 
First we have a C program which mainly acts as a Psuedocode for the Mips assembly which is directly converted to machine code which interacts with the hardware
Contributions by external users is highly incouraged as optimisation of code is needed.
What is a reversable prime square?
Both 169 and 961 are the square of a prime. 169 is the reverse of 961.
We call a number a reversible prime square if:
• It is not a palindrome, and
• It is the square of a prime, and Its reverse is also the square of a prime.
• 169 and 961 are not palindromes, so both are reversible prime squares.


During my time in writing the code: 
I have come to a conclution that reversable primes only occure in odd numbered digit.
Before any reversable prime square there appears a palindrome square prime.
